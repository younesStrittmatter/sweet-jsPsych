A collection of plugins for [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/). These plugins are not part of the official jsPsych library, but are instead mainly developed to be used in [SweetBeen](https://autoresearch.github.io/sweetbean/). They are not guaranteed to be stable or well-documented, but they are free to use and modify.
